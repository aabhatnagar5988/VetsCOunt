        <p>OurTown.com is a privately owned company based in Cincinnati, Ohio which was created in 2007 by a group of “news junkies”.  OurTown grew out of our own interest in what was happening in our own city and evolved into a branded, hyper-local news platform.
        </p>
        
        <p class="padding_top_bottom">
            OurTown started out with 70,000 local sites covering every populated zip code in the United States delivering local news, views, search and commerce. We have since overhauled our approach and have become a real time mobile source for truly hyper local news.
        </p>
        
        <p class="padding_top_bottom">
            When OurTown started we licensed Local Editors to build and run individual local news sites to help bring relative news content to their individual comminutes making up our entire local news network.  We have since modernized our concept with a mobile first platform that is based on individual creators who bring relative content to our users.
